This project is a fork from the Cliche project.

Cliche is a simple command line shell for Java applications.
This version of the project is a continuation and improvement
on the original.

The original Cliche hasn't been updated since it's original
inception, and I prefer Git over Mercural, hence this fork
which is hosted at Github insteadl of Google Code.

The original Cliche is Copyright (c) 2009 Anton Grigoryev, and
can be found at http://code.google.com/p/cliche/

For documentation, please refer to the original code.
For my updates and improvements, please refer to the Wiki at the
Github site:  https://github.com/dudehook/Cliche2/wiki
